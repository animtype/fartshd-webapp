# FartsHD webapp from 2012, and it still works like a charm.
Webapp is a jQuery+transit+iScroll JavaScript page made back in 2010. Initially had worked for IE8, IE9, first Chrome and Firefox back to early 4.0 version, before a major facelift took place. In 2012 a new version emerged with the full support of mobile screens. And since then no major released has been committed. https://fartshd.com/app 

# Phonegap
In 2012 a Phonegap version was published for Windows mobile OS, iOS 4 and Android 2.4. Since 2016 all apps have been removed from stores due to lack of PG score (languages and imagery) and Cordova security holes.
