    <li>To improve our Site or App (we continually strive to improve our Site  and App offerings based on the information and feedback we receive  from you)</li>

  <h3>Do  we use cookies?</h3>

  <h3>How do we share sounds from the App?</h3>
  <p> Each Sound from the App has unique identifier, which we send through URL query (GET method) to the site. The query string also includes a name of the sound, properties and device name. The query is converted into HEX string with des key (fartshdstorage). We don't use url encoded query because we truly believe that user deserves better than ugly url encoded string. </p>
